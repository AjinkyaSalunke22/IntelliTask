# IntelliTask
The goal of the IntelliTask project is to develop a sophisticated To-Do application that leverages AI to interpret human-readable commands and manage tasks efficiently. Users should be able to add, update, delete, and view tasks through simple, natural language inputs, and the AI will handle all CRUD operations accordingly.
